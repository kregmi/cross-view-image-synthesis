## Abstract
Learning to generate natural scenes has always been a challenging task in computer vision. It is even more painstaking when the generation is conditioned on images with drastically different views. This is mainly because understanding, corresponding, and transforming appearance and semantic information across the views is not trivial. In this paper, we attempt to solve the novel problem of cross-view image synthesis, aerial to street-view and vice versa, using conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN). Two new architectures called Crossview Fork (X-Fork) and Crossview Sequential (X-Seq) are proposed to generate scenes with resolutions of 64x64 and 256x256 pixels. X-Fork architecture has a single discriminator and a single generator. The generator hallucinates both the image and its semantic segmentation in the target view. X-Seq architecture utilizes two cGANs. The first one generates the target image which is subsequently fed to the second cGAN for generating its corresponding semantic segmentation map. The feedback from the second cGAN helps the first cGAN generate sharper images. Both of our proposed architectures learn to generate natural images as well as their semantic segmentation maps. The proposed methods show that they are able to capture and maintain the true semantics of objects in source and target views better than the traditional image-to-image translation method which considers only the visual appearance of the scene. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations support the effectiveness of our frameworks, compared to two state of the art methods, for natural scene generation across drastically different views.

## Code
Our code is borrowed from [pix2pix](https://github.com/phillipi/pix2pix). The data loader is modified to handle images and semantic segmentation maps.

## Setup

### Getting Started
- Install torch and dependencies from https://github.com/torch/distro
- Install torch packages `nngraph` and `display`
```bash
luarocks install nngraph
luarocks install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/szym/display/master/display-scm-0.rockspec
```
- Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:kregmi/cross-view-image-synthesis.git
cd cross-view-image-synthesis
```

- Training the model
```bash
DATA_ROOT=./datasets/AB_AsBs name=sample_images which_direction=a2g phase=sample th train_fork.lua
```
- For CPU only training: 
```bash
DATA_ROOT=./datasets/AB_AsBs name=sample_images which_direction=a2g phase=sample gpu=0 cudnn=0 th train_fork.lua
```
- Testing the model:
```bash
DATA_ROOT=./datasets/AB_AsBs name=sample_images which_direction=a2g phase=sample which_epoch=35 th test_fork.lua 
```
The test results will be saved to: `./results/sample_images/35_net_G_sample/images/`.

## Training and Test data
### Datasets
The original datasets are available here:
1. [GT-CrossView](https://github.com/lugiavn/gt-crossview)
2. [CVUSA](http://cs.uky.edu/~jacobs/datasets/cvusa/)

Ground Truth semantic segmentation maps are not available for the Dayton (GT-CrossView) dataset. We used RefineNet trained on CityScapes for generating semantic segmentation maps and used them as Gound Truth segmaps in our experiments. Please cite their papers if you use the dataset. We have shared the segmentation maps of Dayton Dataset here [Dayton SegMaps](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DXSSMOAUC5g8813k938v58oY-GvdSjJL). 

Segmentation maps for CVUSA dataset are available with the dataset. Please follow the instruction in this [link](https://github.com/kregmi/cross-view-image-synthesis/issues/18#issuecomment-435638176) to convert them to the segmaps used in this project.


Train/Test splits for Dayton Dataset can be downloaded from here [Dayton](https://github.com/kregmi/cross-view-image-synthesis/tree/master/datasets/dayton_split). 

For CVUSA dataset experiments, we used the same Train/Test split as provided in the dataset.

### Generating Pairs
Refer to [pix2pix](https://github.com/phillipi/pix2pix/blob/master/scripts/combine_A_and_B.py) for steps and code to generate pairs of images required for training/testing.

First concatenate the streetview and aerial images followed by concatenating their segmentation maps and finally concatenating them all along the columns. Each concatenated image file in the dataset will contain {A,B,As,Bs}, 
where A=streetview image, B=aerial image, As=segmentation map for streetview image, and Bs=segmentation map for aerial image.

## Train
```bash
DATA_ROOT=/path/to/data/ name=expt_name which_direction=a2g th train_fork.lua
```
Switch `a2g` to `g2a` to train in opposite direction.

Models are saved to `./checkpoints/expt_name` (can be changed by passing `checkpoint_dir=your_dir` in train_fork.lua).

See `opt` in train_fork.lua for additional training options.

## Test
```bash
DATA_ROOT=/path/to/data/ name=expt_name which_direction=a2g phase=val th test_fork.lua
```

This will run the model named `expt_name` in direction `a2g` on all images in `/path/to/data/val`.

Result images, and a webpage to view them, are saved to `./results/expt_name` (can be changed by passing `results_dir=your_dir` in test_fork.lua).

See `opt` in test_fork.lua for additional testing options.

## Models
Pretrained models can be downloaded here.
